CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2" with any of

  Add the installation prefix of "SDL2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SDL2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "SDL2"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
